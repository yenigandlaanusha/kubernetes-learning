**Service Discovery**
Change the selector name in service.yaml file, will the service discovery able to detect the pods . it shouldn't detect the pods becoz the label in deployment and service.yaml file is different
and try to apply the service and access the service either browser or curl, we will see that the application is not acceptable.
so by just chnaging the labels and selectors we understood that service is not discoverable.

**Load Balancing**
Why do we need load balancing?
If we have only one replica and we have 100 request, it will be difficult for one replica to serve all the requests.so on depending upon the load of your application , we can create multiple replicas
but by default the deployments or the pods donot have load balancing.If we create a service we get a load balancing

Get the pods

**
kubectl get pods
